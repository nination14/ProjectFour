OOP Game Show App
By Ahirina Rivera

Thank you for taking the time to look over my project, I am going for exceeds. I have personally customize my back ground, change colors on some text fonts, added the interactive physical keyboard. I also made the game lost overlay to be a bit transpernt so you can still see Mac when you have lost. I had a lot of fun making this project, it was challenging but rewardful.
