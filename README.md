By Ahirina Rivera

Thank you for taking the time to look over my project, I am going for exceeds. I have personally customize my back ground, change colors on some text fonts, added the interactive physical keyboard, and my letters dont show when highlighten. I also made the game lost overlay to be a bit transperent so you can still see Mac when you have lost.
